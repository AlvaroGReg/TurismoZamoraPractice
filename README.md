Web design practice about Zamora

Ive focus on using low num of code lines to generate a "big" web (big for me, biggest ive done).

Work still in progress, waiting to learn about use of DB in web and improving the info about different pics.

Must to feature the (again for me) new nav ways i used and the a two uses of acordion animations, first (menu in <720px) did by following tutos and second (expand data)
created from scratch using what ive learned.

Look "Issues" for more info, there will be tons.
